### Main objectives

Objective 1: This is a very simple API toying-around. I try to grab a deck of posts, and filter in their main ideas by scanning out most commonl used words. 

Objective 2: MAIN Objective. Additionally, we do some code work that targets specific cases on how to scan and pull some general analytics from posts. We also have an automation in place
that, when activated, makes a post for us.
