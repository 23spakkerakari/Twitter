## Main idea
A project where I work with the Twitter API -- allows me to interact with Twitter.  
This is a derivation of a much older project. In the older project, I used a Twitter API to work on some basic filtering out
commands with native Twitter methods. 
In the updated version, I add some additional functionalities with posting. To get more comfortable with REST APIs


### Project Board and Planning
Check out my project board to see my timeline of this project. 

In my taskboard I list my major tasks, and the design steps 

### Main objectives

Objective 1: This is a very simple API toying-around. I try to grab a deck of posts, and filter in their main ideas by scanning out most commonl used words. 

Objective 2: MAIN Objective. Additionally, we do some code work that targets specific cases on how to scan and pull some general analytics from posts. We also have an automation in place
that, when activated, makes a post for us.
